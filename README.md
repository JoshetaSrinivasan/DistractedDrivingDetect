# Motivation
  I found that piercing the hobbyist Brain-Computer-Interface(BCI) realm to be diffiuclt. Firtly, it is expensive - specifically because an EEG device can cost anywhere from 200 dollars to more than a few thousand. Second, it requires quite a wealth of experience - Signal processing, Neural Networks, Electronics, etc. This project is my attempt at creating a useful, relatively functional BCI at relatively low-cost and minimal experience. 

# About the Project 
  This is a neurofeedback system that detects Mind-Wandering during driving: it reads your brain electrical activity, detects if you're Mind-Wandering, and beeps if you do.
